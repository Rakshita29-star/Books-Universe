        <p2>R.K. Narayan was a truly gifted writer, and loaded his fiction with beautiful descriptions of things that he observed in his world. "The Guide" by R.K. Narayan is an excellent example that how beautiful and intriguing simplicity can be. 
            The Guide is about Raju, who tells his story in the present and past. He has been in prison and has taken refuge in an empty temple by a river. The locals begin to believe he is a holy man. Interspersed is the story of Raju's past, his childhood, his time as a tourist guide. Then his affair with a married woman and its consequences. Raju is a rogue who is often self serving, but has some likeable qualities. The end is left open; has Raju really become a holy man as he fasts for rain.
            There is a strong comedic element in the book, but it is also a fable. Human issues are addressed rather than politics directly and critics have pointed out that there is little to relate the book to a time or political background. Hence, I think the fable element.
            It has been suggested that Narayan is easy to read and hard to understand. He is certainly easy to read, but the end of the novel is enigmatic; The Guide is certainly thought provoking. sheer simplicity of language and expression.
            A flawless story woven around deeply flawed characters. This book is simple, genius, tragic and thoroughly Indian. Must read.</p2><br><br>
            <p3>i saw the movie around 2009 in my childhood ....and since i had had a desire to read it ..to know the ideas..to feel the characters in other than movie perspective....R.K. narayan sir enchants us with his beautifully embellished narration..all characters are good, raju nalini marco all 
                .....but the end is left open ..to think by reader thyself ....and 
                .......the reader makes run horses of mind in all direction of perception whether raju indeed was a holy man or just a fallacious tragic one!!!!</p3>
                <p4>What I saw in it I think is different, I read novel and watched the film as well. The three characters morco, ranu and rosie are all after their passion and ambition though the emotion of love as shown in movie tried to deviate them. Secondly the theme of guide is parodied in the character of raju as railway guide, as guide to rosie and God himself acts as an ultimate guide, really God and His realisation is ultimate guide. In the novel, whether it will rain or not but spiritual rain had already rained on the soul of raju, he had realised the ultimate truth the HE is the ultimate guide</p4>
